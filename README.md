# World_Weather_Analysis
## Repository Overview
The purpose of this repository is to create random latitudes and longitudes and create Databases from them. 
The Database is strictly based on habitable land (No ocean/lakes) we created over 1500 latitude, longitude pairs. Out of the pairs created, around 30% are on land, and even less are considered habitable. 
with the introduction of this, we created an algorithm that tells us the weather conditions, and helps us find the nearest hotel within a 5KM radius of the lat/lng tuple.
